## 🧑‍💻 About Me
I’m a career-switcher from Lisbon, Portugal, with a background as a sound engineer. Years in post-production taught me discipline, attention to detail, and clear communication with clients and teams — skills I now bring to web development.

Over the past year, I’ve built 50+ frontend projects, developed full-stack applications, and consistently practiced coding challenges. My portfolio highlights hands-on experience with full-stack development, responsive design, and real-world problem-solving. I also use AI tools like ChatGPT and Claude to speed up learning and debugging, while ensuring all code is written and debugged by me.

I’ve completed Colt Steele’s Full-Stack Web Development and MySQL bootcamps, alongside courses in Figma, SQL, and Python. My goal is to grow as a frontend or full-stack developer on a team where I can contribute with problem-solving, a user-focused mindset, and high-quality work.
