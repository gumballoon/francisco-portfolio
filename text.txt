About Me
I’m a career-switcher who spent years as a sound engineer in post-production studios, working closely with clients to ensure high-quality results.
Now I bring that same attention to detail and creativity to web development.
Over the past year, I’ve built 50+ frontend projects, a full-stack web app, and consistently practiced coding challenges. 
My portfolio showcases hands-on experience with full-stack development, responsive design, and real-world problem-solving.
I leverage AI tools like Claude and ChatGPT to accelerate learning and debugging, but all project code is written and debugged by me.
I’m also committed to continuous growth. 
I’ve completed Colt Steele’s Full-Stack Web Development and SQL Bootcamps, plus complementary courses in web development, Figma, SQL and Python. 
Each course and project builds on the last, helping me become a more versatile and well-rounded developer.
My goal is to join a team where I can grow as a frontend or full-stack developer while contributing with my problem-solving and user-focused mindset.
